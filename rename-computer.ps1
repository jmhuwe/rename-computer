# rename-computer.ps1
#
# This script is designed to be pushed out to a batch of computers and rename
# them to <prefix><tag> based on their serial number.  The script gets the
# information from the $csv variable, which needs to be defined in a csv format.
# The design decision to include the csv information in the script instead of a
# separate csv file was made in order to easily deploy the script through
# Intune's built in powershell functionality which only allows for a single ps1
# file to be uploaded.
#
# The $csv variable needs to have the headers $csv="Tag,Serial,Prefix and the
# data should follow, one computer per line in that order.  At the end of the
# data, it should be closed with a following double quote.  It is important to 
# make sure your csv data does not contain any single or double quotes.
# Example:
#    $csv="Tag,Serial,Prefix
#    12345,System Serial Number,Test-
#    40001,4CD03809Z4,MDE-
#    40002,4CD0380B1R,MDE-
#    40003,4CD03805LM,MDE-
#    "
#
# The script is controled by several administrator defined variables. 
#     $testRun - provides a way to test the script without rebooting or renaming
#                the computer.
#     $forceReboot - forces the system to restart after the name change.
#     $rebootTimeoutInSec - if rebooting, how many seconds do you want to give
#                the end user to save docs, etc. before rebooting.
#     $notifyUser - notify the user using the Windows 10 toast notifications
# Please read the comments above each variable for a more detailed description
# of each variable.
#
# This script is provided as-is and Josh Huwe nor the Mississippi Department of
# Education make any warranty as to its effectiveness, nor that that it won't
# destroy your computers and burn them down to the ground.  Use at your own risk!
# It is highly recommended that this script is initially deployed to small test
# batches of computers to ensure the behavior is expected.
#
# If you run into issues, hit me up in email and I will make a best effort among
# my other commitments to help you figure out what is going wrong.

# Begin user defined variables
#

# Will this be a test run? If $true, then the script will run through 
# but not rename or restart the computer.
# Set this variable to $true or $false
# Example:
#    $testRun = $true
$testRun = $false

# Will this computer be forced to restart? If $true, then if the script 
# finds a serial number match and is not a test run, it will then rename
# and restart the computer in $rebootTimeoutInSec seconds. 
# Set this variable to $true or $false
# Example:
#    $forceReboot = $false
$forceReboot = $true

# If the computer is being forced to reboot, how many seconds do you 
# want to delay reboot? This number is also used for toast notifcation 
# timeout.
# Set this variable to a positive integer value.
# Example:
#    $rebootTimeoutInSec = 30
$rebootTimeoutInSec = 300

# Do you want to notify the user using the Windows 10 toast notifications?
# If set to $true, it will use the toast notification.  If $false, then it
# will write output to the command line.
# Set this variable to $true or $false
# Example:
#    $notifyUser = $false
$notifyUser = $true

# This variable is the csv of your asset tag numbers, serial numbers, and
# prefixes. Make sure the first line is $csv="Tag,Serial,Prefix
# and make sure the last line is a single ". Make sure there are no single or
# double quotes in any of the individual values.
# Example:
#    $csv="Tag,Serial,Prefix
#    12345,System Serial Number,Test-
#    40001,4CD03809Z4,MDE-
#    40002,4CD0380B1R,MDE-
